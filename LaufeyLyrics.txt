This view used to bring a smile to my face
Lately, its done nothing but remind me of the way
The way that you used to give me butterflies
Took me twenty-one days to walk our former paradise
Paradise, bu-bu-bu-day duh-duh doo

Step by step, brick by brick I'm reclaiming what's mine
This city is way too small to give away to just one guy
Street by street, breath by breath from the Back Bay to the sky
I'm taking back my city, I'm taking back my life

The caf√© where you asked me for my name
The bookstore we spent five hours, hiding from the rain
It's like a game of Monopoly except I steal back all my property
And leave you on the ground
And I know that I'll see you one day on the street with a girl on your arm
But I won't let that keep me from this town
From this town
From this town, ooh

Step by step, brick by brick I'm reclaiming what's mine
This city is way too small to give away to just one guy
Street by street, breath by breath from the Back Bay to the sky
I'm taking back my city, I'm taking back my life
I'm taking back my city

Magnolia, she could have anyone in the world
Floats around town in a golden gown
Born in a castle on a cloud
Magnolia, prettiest girl that I know
Stars in her eyes, handpicked from the skies
Beautiful soul

How can I compete with her?
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia

Magnolia, she can move oceans and rivers with ease
A word from her lips, her sirens kiss
Will send you straight into abyss
Magnolia, I wish she'd give her secrets away
Enchants everyone and I think it'd be fun
To be like her someday

But I cannot compete with her
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia
Magnolia

Maybe one day I'll fall in a bookstore
Into the arms of a guy
We'll sneak into bars and gaze at the stars
Surrounded by fireflies

Oh, I'd like to sleep in till two on a Sunday
And listen to the bluebirds sigh
Get soaked in the rain and smile through the pain
Slow dance under stormy skies

Maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck, no one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love

Oh, maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck, no one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So, with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So, with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love, love, love

I spent months gazing at him, sitting 'cross the hall
His dark hair, his glasses, perfect overall
He looked so serious
He was mysterious
One Tuesday he caught me sneaking in a stare
He shot me a smile, I nearly tumbled out my chair
He said, "Who are you? My name is James"
And that's when I fell into the flames

Turns out he's a fool
That James, oh, James
Oh, how I wasted my days
Oh, dreaming, dreaming of James

He said, "Do you like museums? They're open late tonight"
How about we go together, just you and I
And maybe we can have a drink or two
I'd like to learn about you
But James just thought it was alright
To go ahead and talk about himself all night
Then he really felt he had to say
That he'd be a millionaire one day

Turns out he's a fool
That James, oh, James
Oh, how I wasted my days
Oh, dreaming, dreaming of James

My eyes rolled to the back of my head
It seemed like the night would never end
At one point I just stopped listening
His voice just became too sickening

The sky's a different kind of blue
Wanted it to be you
Some things just aren't meant to be
It's easy to say
I still can't see
You with anybody else
There's no amount of wealth
That could ease this poor goodbye
Soften the fall from your sky
Ooh

It's so typical of me
And I'm sure that you'd agree, oh
That I can be a little much
I overthink
I scared you off
My spiral begins right on cue
I wonder if I'll ever find someone new

I have to get off Instagram
I keep on going back
Looking at our memories
I know that you will soon delete
We turn to strangers in a day
Now you walk away
Every time I catch your eye
When did you become so shy?
Ooh

It's so typical of me
I'm sure that you'd agree, oh
That I can be a little much
I overthink
I scared you off
My spiral begins right on cue
This time I swear I won't find someone new
Someone new

It's come to my attention that I don't show enough
Of what I think, it's only when I drink, I open up
But I promise that I love you
Even with that hair-do, I'm sorry I made fun of it
It's not your fault it looks like shit

I have never tolerated someone for so long
I've never laughed so much, I haven't written a sad song
There's no one else
I'd rather fall asleep with and dream with
You're my best friend in the world

When we're ninety-eight and ninety-nine
Tumblin' down the stairs, you'll barely catch me in time
We'll argue about what to watch on TV
Finally, pick a movie, then we'll fall asleep
We'll still be a little bit strange, some things never change

It's funny 'cause you drive me half-insane
A universe without you would be thoroughly mundane
There's no one else
I'd rather fall in love with and that is
My best friend in the world

You're my best friend in the world

Will you let me come closer to you
I know that you're older, but what can I do
I leave in the morning I'll forget that I am surely falling

Grew up in a case of fragile glass
But hammer away it's time to crash
And as it shatters let me shatter into you

The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room is spinning
Nerve on my bone
I'm shaking oh no
I'm talking though I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
I've never been so fragile

It's been a year and 40 days
Since you picked me up and swept me away
I wanted to run with you into the midnight sun with you

Now I sit around and rust in rain
Turn into dust as I just wait
For someone to hold me like you did that night I still remember

The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room kept spinning
Round I'm alone
New town on my own
I'm missing you I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
I've never been so fragile
Fragile

Beautiful stranger sitting right there
Looked up at me and my dark curly hair
Looked back for a second didn't want to be rude
I tend to fall in love on the tube

Beautiful stranger sitting right there
Reading the newspaper stuck to his chair
I swore that he smiled and I felt my heart drop
Heard the doors open came to my stop

What if I hadn't left the train at Ladbroke Grove
Would I know his name?
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairy tale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again

Beautiful stranger catching my stare
It's fate we collided right then
Back there I wonder if he felt the same thing too
Innocent crush on the morning commute

What if I would've stayed on the train
Dared to stand up and ask for his name
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairy tale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again

My beautiful stranger will have to remain
A love that come and left with the train
My beautiful stranger

I've rejected affection
For years and years
Now I have it and damn it
It's kind of weird

He tells me I'm pretty
Don't know how to respond
I tell him that he's pretty too
Can I say that? Don't have a clue

With every passing moment
I surprise myself
I'm scared of flies
I'm scared of guys
Someone please help

Cause I think I've fallen
In love this time
I blinked and suddenly I had a Valentine

What if he's the last one I kiss?
What if he's the only one I'll ever miss?
Maybe I should run, I'm only twenty-one
I don't even know who I want to become

I've lost all control of my heartbeat now
Got caught in a romance with him somehow
I still feel a shock through every bone
When I hear an "I love you"
Cause now I've got someone to lose

The first one to ever like me back
I'm seconds away from a heart attack
How the hell did I fall in love this time?
And honestly, I can't believe I get to call you mine
I blinked and suddenly
I had a Valentine
Valentine

I still freeze when I look at these faded photographs from February
Last twenty second or twenty third
Shared some dumplings, whispered some words
We had two, maybe three bucks saved between us
Sat in blankets on the floor
Used to wish for money in rain
A west side apartment, paper plane

Ooh, then you left in May
Took the wrong long way back home
Wish I'd known that I had all I could want
In our tiny apartment above the Chinese restaurant

Street sounds blistered with neon lights
Heard the neighbors snoring every other night
Eating dumplings from next door
Finish all my plate, give us some more
Didn't realize we had it all
Even when the roof came caving in the fall
Oh, I loved you more than you know
Covered in flakes of crystal white snow

Ooh, then you left in May
Took the wrong long way back home
Wish I'd known that I had all I could want
In our tiny apartment above the Chinese restaurant
Ooh-ooh

Do you live in New York city
Or a couple towns away
Wherever you are
I'd jump in my car just to see you today

Will I meet you at a party?
Sit next to you on a plane
Maybe I already know you and loathe you
But we'll fall in love someday

Dear soulmate
Do you think of me
Cause I do
Do you have green eyes
Are they brown like mine
Do you have a sister too
Dear soulmate
One day I'll give this song to you

Will we drive up to the mountains
Camp in a little tent
When the bears come at night
Will you put up a fight
Or will you hide with me and my flashlight

Do you sleep on the right side
'Cause I prefer the left
Will you make me buttered toast
Perhaps a morning roast
When I wake up and I'm sad

Dear soulmate
Do you think of me
Cause I do
Do you have blue eyes
Are they brown like mine
Do you have a sister too
Dear soulmate
One day I'll give this song to you

Dear soulmate
I can't wait to fall in love with you

I don't know where to look
Don't know where to walk
Don't know how I've been acting lately
Absent minded, kind of crazy
Talking to my room, singing for the moon
Watch the hours melt away
I sit and dream all night and day

Lately I've been in a haze
Running late, can't think straight
The world feels smaller, yet the trees look taller
There's enchantment in the air
I know I sound stupid, I do
That's what love will do to you

Read my favorite book for the hundredth time
At least I know of how it ends
In real life, it just all depends
Losing my mind, drunk on jazz and wine
Basking in the blinding bliss of
Flushed out cheeks, a good night kiss

Lately I've been in a haze
Running late, can't think straight
The world feels smaller, yet the trees look taller
There's enchantment in the air
I know I sound stupid, I do
That's what love will do to you
That's what love will do to you
That's what love will do to you

I've never been in love before
Now all at once it's you
It's you for evermore

I've never been in love before
I thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score

But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour

So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour

So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

I've really never been
In love before

In a perfect world, I wouldn't have met you at all
In a perfect world, I would've said "Hi" and moved on
Unfortunately, I don't know anything 'bout love
And its foolish tendencies
And just like Chet, I tend to fall in love too easily
In a perfect world, I'd live out my days by the sea
In a light blue cottage, just the sand, the ocean, and me
Unfortunately, I'm too romantic dramatic for that reality
I go ahead and just like Chet, I fall in love too easily

Why did you put me through
Eleven months of "You're so pretty's," "I miss you's"?
It's absurd what even occurred between autumn and spring
If you never loved me

In a perfect world, I wouldn't have met you that night
Would've stayed with my friends and danced 'til the morning light
Unfortunately, I can't trust anybody that tells me anything
I go ahead and just like that, I fall a little hard and fast
At every turn, I feel a little heartbreak and a little burn
And just like Chet, I tend to fall in love too easily
Just like Chet, I tend to fall in love too easily

So enchanting in every way
It's everlasting every day
Sweet obsession, rose bouquets
Oh, it's heaven or so they say

I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is so divine
Are these songs just telling plain old lies?
Cause that's everything I know about love
Everything I know about love

I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all too much
That's everything I know about love

Captivating angel eyes
Stomach sick with butterflies
When will someone prove to me
That this isn't fantasy

Cause I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is so divine
Are these songs just telling plain old lies?
Cause that's everything I know about love
That's everything I know about love

Oh, I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all too much
That's everything I know about love

Oh, I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all too much
That's everything I know about love

Moved out to a new city
June is dawning down on me
And all that I can find's

A sickly romance in the air
Lovers stroll without a care in sight
Oh, this can't be right...

Cause the sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friends found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love
And I'm falling behind

Touched the ocean fell right in
Stepped outside and burned my skin
My life won't go my way

Bossa Nova in my room
Hope that I'll find someone too
To love, because

The sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friends found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love
And I'm falling behind

Everybody's falling in love
Everybody's falling in love
Everybody's falling in love but me

I want to say hi to you
I have no reason to
But I thought of you while driving today
With Louis on the radio
I remembered how you loved him so
We'd play his records, dance real slow

I guess
That I'm missing you
I know it's out of the blue
I haven't thought of you for more than weeks
Now I'm dreaming of the moonlight glow
On your little studio
We both knew I had to go away

Away to a place
Much bigger than this
Away from the land of fish and sea
To something new, a skyline view
4300 miles from you

It's complicated
You are my hometown love
Moved to the city of
Angels and I wish that you were here
Now I'm in my empty studio
Don't dare to call, don't dare to know
If you want to say hello to me

Now I'm dreaming of your moonlight glow
From my empty studio
Hoping that you'll say hello to me

Silly boy don't talk to me
I don't have the energy
Please don't ask to
Dance with me tonight

I do better on my own
I don't mean to come off cold
But my dear I'm all danced out tonight

Now the gin is hitting me
And it's almost half past three
Am I crazy or seeing things
I'm sorry if I can't go for another swing

You're a charmer that's for sure
But I can't stand anymore
Shame I would've danced with you tonight

Now the gin is hitting me
And it's almost half past three
Am I crazy or seeing things
I'm sorry if I can't go for another swing

You're a charmer that's for sure
But I can't stand anymore
Shame I would've danced with you tonight
Would've danced with you tonight

Up the staircase, first door to your left
Walls of white, a window, 10x10
A treasure chest of everything I've ever known
Safe inside my childhood home

Every record I have ever heard
I know every melody and every word
A little book of every dream I ever had
Sleeping in that twin sized bed

All of the laughter
All the sleepless nights
Waiting for ever after
Snow falling outside, keeping on the night light

Cardboard boxes covering the floor
Guess I won't be living in here anymore
Take down the posters of the pop-stars on the wall
Empty room, it looks so small

All of the laughter
All the sleepless nights
Waiting for ever after
Snow falling outside, keeping on the night light

Take down the posters of the pop stars on the wall
Empty room it feels so small

All of the laughter
All the sleepless nights
Waiting for ever after
Snow falling outside, keeping on the night light

Slow down
Give me just a moment
I'm so grown now in my own apartment
Cooking my own dinner spaghetti for one
Though, I'm gettin' older
My life has just begun

I wish it would slow down, even for a second
I'm so old now, left my adolescence
Going out to parties and getting way too drunk
Think I found somebody
But don't think that it's love

I wish it would slow down
Slow down, mm-mm

Someday, I won't be in my twenties
In a new state, maybe even married
I'll have my own children
They're tired of being young
They'll ask me about their futures
I'll tell my little ones

Baby, slow down
Slow down
Slow down

I just want to take you home
Call a taxi in the snow
When the driver can't see
Steal a kiss from me, ooh-ooh, ooh

Realized, I forgot the keys
Think that it was meant to be
'Cause we sat outside
You looked in my eyes, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

When the sun goes away in the autumn
And the leaves trickle down from the trees
The heat of the summer's forgotten
You'll be here, so lucky for me

You don't tell me to shut up
Even when I talk too much
You smile at me
Say, "Don't worry"

When the sun goes away in the autumn
And the leaves trickle down from the trees
The heat of the summer's forgotten
You'll be here, so lucky for me

You'll be here, so lucky for me

Why do I love the moon so much?
How come I crave a stranger's touch?
Hmm, lately, love's been like a curse
I speak my mind and don't think first

These are my questions for the universe

Why do I sleep all day and night?
Live in this puzzling age and time
Why would I kiss a boy just to get hurt?
Plant a living flower on this dying earth?

These are my questions for the universe

Falling in love feels more like crashing
Stars spin around my head
So I'm asking

Will my worries ever melt away?
Run out of sentences to say
Wish that I could put this into better words
Will I ever fall in love or will I always search?

These are my questions for the universe

These are my questions for the universe

Let me be your dreamer, let me float
I can see the whole world from my own little cloud
Up on the Milky Way
I'll stay here forever and a day

You can't pin me down
I fear all-solid ground
I'd rather be alone at tea
Love when nobody's making me

Oh, boys just make me cry
Believe me, I have tried
I've made my rounds
Kissed some mouths
Trust me, I don't want a single soul around

Oh, I'm giving up, I'm throwing in my hat
I can't take another lifeless little chat
I'm moving up into a cloud, into my fantasy

And no boy's gonna be so smart
As to try and pierce my porcelain heart
No boy's gonna kill the dreamer in me

Some might call me mad
The worst this town has had
I fell right down the rabbit hole
Legends say I fell so fast I lost my soul

Oh, my melancholic days
Are few and far away
I've had enough
Called it off
As far as I'm concerned, this witch is numb to love

Oh, I'm giving up, I'm throwing in my hat
I can't take another lifeless little chat
I'm moving up into a cloud, into my fantasy

And no boy's gonna be so smart
As to try and pierce my porcelain heart
And no boy's gonna kill the dreamer in me

And no boy's gonna be so smart
As to try and pierce my porcelain heart
No boy's gonna kill the dreamer in me

I'll never forget
How stupid in love I felt
I'll always regret
How I couldn't ever tell
That you walked a little faster, left me behind
Kissed me with somebody else in mind
I loved you so much that I settled for less
Oh, you were my everything, I was your second best

Lying awake, I'd watch as you'd dream at night
Dream at night
Nightingale singing half-hearted lullabies
Well, you swung me around in that midsummer dance
Held me in close as you thought of your past
I love way too much, oh, this hurts to confess
Oh, you were my everything, I was your second best

You've given me nothing to miss
Honestly, life has been much better since
I spoke to you last
Why am I still wondering if I stand a chance
Or if you'd have me back?

Everyone warned me you were a bad idea
I never listen, maybe I will next year
When I've walked a little further into my life
Fallen in love and left you behind
But I'm still a little in love with this mess
Oh, you were my everything, I'm just your second best
Second best

One more kiss
Wine-stained lips
I don't want to go to sleep yet

Pale moonlight
Misty eyes
I'll allow myself to have him just tonight

I hold on to every ounce of sin
I know he don't love me quite like I love him
I swear to myself as he leaves at dawn
This will end
'Til he haunts me again

Rose perfume
Low-lit room
I'll pretend you'll stay forever

Lay me down
Ghostly sounds
Haunt the hallways as he wraps me around

And I hold on to every ounce of sin
I know he don't love me quite like I love him
I swear to myself as he leaves at dawn
This will end
'Til he haunts me again

Time's moving so much slower lately
It's like the world's playing a joke
Laughing at me for falling foolishly again
But something's different
With you

Traffic on Sunset doesn't faze me
I'm just unusually composed
That is until I touch you and I can't pretend
I lose myself again
I do

I'm all in, I'm falling
Can't get back up
Can't think right
Too tongue-tied
It must be love

Friends asking me where I've been hiding
I'm losing hours in your eyes
Lost in your wonderland, I hope I'm never found
There's no one else around
Tonight

I'm not so used to being happy
Now I just float down every street
You made a sappy, stupid something out of me
The kind I swore I'd never be
I'm awake inside a dream

I'm all in, I'm falling
Can't get back up
Can't think right
Too tongue-tied
Come kiss me
Convince me
This must be
It must be love
Must be love

I still can't believe
That you noticed me
An ocean away
The heavens would say
It was meant to be

I'll never forget
The first time I saw you then
Primrose at three
You had all of me
Without saying a word

I don't recognize myself
I'm dancing down streets, smiling to strangers
Idiotic things
I trace it all back, 3:30 AM
That night something turned in my heart
While you were sleeping, I fell in love

I can't quite believe
You think I'm beautiful
Must be a trick
A tag and you're it
Kind of foolery

Then you take my hand
Kiss me on the cheek
A light-pink bouquet
A promise you'll stay
And I start to believe

I don't recognize myself
I'm writing a love song. Who've I become?
There must be something wrong
I trace it all back, 3:30 AM
That night something turned in my heart
While you were sleeping, I fell in love

Floorboards creaking in my home
Deathly silence when alone
Oh, I wish that you were here right now

So unlike me somehow, I
Fell in love in just three nights
Those November days still haunting me

When the gold rays fell on your skin
And my hair got caught in the wind
The choir sang a melancholic hymn

In the morning you would be gone
I'd be mourning, tryna hold on
To the memory of your lips
God, I'm so lovesick
What have you done to me?

Let me in your atmosphere
Inching closer but I fear
That I'll love so much you'll slip away

Getting twisted in my head
Dreams are nightmares in my bed
Since the last night that I spent with you

When the gold rays fell on your skin
And my hair got caught in the wind
The choir sang a melancholic hymn

In the morning, you're not in my bed
I'll just sleep until I fall dead
To the memory of your lips
God, I'm so lovesick
What have you done to me?

Should've figured
That you'd go back to New York
Don't consider me
When you run back to her

You don't have to hide it
I know why you went
Said you needed space
I know better than that

Could've fought for you
But I just let you leave
Hurt too much to consider
You didn't love me

The mountains of LA
Will weep through the night
Driving down sunset's a terrible sight

Left me and the ocean for your old flame
Holding back my tears I couldn't make you stay
Can't quit this, so damn wicked
To leave California and me

I imagine you holding her in your arms
Laughing bout how I thought that you were the one
I get so anxious and maybe I'm young
The first sign of trouble and I bite my tongue

Left me and the ocean for your old flame
Holding back my tears I couldn't make you stay
Can't quit this so damn wicked
To leave California and me

I made a promise
To distance myself
Took a flight, through aurora skies
Honestly, I didn't think about
How we didn't say goodbye
Just see you very soon

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

So I didn't call you
For 16 long days
And I should get, a cigarette
For so much restraint
No matter how long I resist temptation
I will always lose

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

I've done the math
There's no solution
We'll never last
Why can't I let go of this?

So I broke my promise
I called you last night
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
If it weren't for the sight of a boy
Who looked just like you
Standing out on Melrose Avenue

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same

Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
She's so perfect
Blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love
At least just let me say

That when I talk to you
Oh, cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed staring
Into the blue?
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today

That when I talk to you
Oh, cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start

Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand

Misty, walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near

Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?
That's why I'm following you
Following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone?
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

Too misty
And too much in love

I won't pretend I've been desolate
I won't pretend I've been blue
It happened so quickly
One second it hit me
I've fallen quite hard over you

I won't pretend I've been anxious
Just like I've always been
This time it's sticking
And time just stops ticking
When I have my arms around you

Four-leaf clovers and lucky dimes
Coincidences and cosmic signs
Have proved that I am quite naive
I'm falling fast, filling gravity
And all that I see is serendipity

Ran into you on the corner
Of 90 and Central Park West
Oh, how it thrilled me
I thank the big city
And this I will rarely confess

In years when we're losing our memory
The world's taken leaps over time
I hope that you'll look at me like I'm still 23
Hope that you'll still be mine

Four-leaf clovers and lucky dimes
Coincidences and cosmic signs
Have proved that I am quite naive
I'm falling fast, filling gravity
I swear that this time it's serendipity
Serendipity
Serendipity

Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair
Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere
Voices echo in the gym, another girl's had her first kiss
Please don't think too much of it, darling

I'm so sorry that they pick you last
Try to say your foreign name and laugh
I know that you feel loud
So different from the crowd
Of big blue eyes and long blond hair and boys that stare

But baby know that

You'll grow up and
Grow so tough and
Charm them
Write your story
Fall in love a little too
The things you thought you'd never do

I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze
Myself at thirteen
And just let her know
Know that she's beautiful

Keep on going with your silly dream
Life is prettier than it may seem
One day you'll be up on stage
Little girls will scream your name
The days of tears and failure fears and no one cares

Will all make sense, 'cause

You'll grow up and
Grow so confident and
Write your story
Fall in love a little too
The things you thought you'd never do

I wish I could go back and give her a squeeze
Myself at thirteen
And just let her know
Know that she's beautiful

Wrapped me in your arms
Leaned in and whispered
"Keep me in your heart"
I'm so bewildered
What's this new desire called?
I didn't know that much at all
'Bout love before
But now, I think I'm learning

You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us, you kissed me goodnight

You bewitch me
Every damn second you're with me
I try to think straight
But I'm falling so badly, I'm coming apart
You wrote me a note, cast a spell on my heart

And bewitched me
Bewitched me

You're not even gone
I already miss you
What's going on?
I've never been through
This all-consuming fire fuming
Cursing at the moon and losing
All control and crying
'Cause I think I'm falling

You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us, you kissed me goodnight

You bewitch me
Every damn second you're with me
I try to think straight
But I'm falling so badly, I'm coming apart
You wrote me a note, cast a spell on my heart

And bewitched me
Bewitched
You bewitched me

Why don't we
Call it for what it is
Can't remember the last time we kissed
And it tickled my heart
I think that it's best that we spend time apart

I just yawn
Listening to you
Talk about yourself again
And again

I'm bored
Bored of this love
Oh, I'm bored
Bored of this talk
And maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting
Baby keep talking but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But baby, I'm bored

Did you know
I wept in my room last night
Bet you didn't know you make me cry
'Cause you're so self-possessed
Charming at first but you've made me depressed
So I'm leaving in the morning

'Cause I'm bored
Bored of this love
Oh, I'm bored
Bored of this talk
And maybe you're just way too plain to be interesting
Baby, keep talking but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But baby, I'm bored

You followed me out and said, "Darling, don't leave."
Your passionate monologue woke up the street
"I'll marry you someday. You're perfect for me."
I got in my car, just to drown out your plea

'Cause I'm bored
Bored of this love
Oh, I'm bored
Bored of this talk
And maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting
Baby, keep talking but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But baby, I'm bored
Ah

I've been having trouble sleeping
Trouble dreaming, trouble being
I've been seeing double
Black and blue
The trouble is we never were
More than friends
Just a blur

I've been havin' trouble
Standing tall
Reaching for my phone
Just to have no one to call
Trouble with my momma
Asking how I am
How can I tell her, I'm crying 'bout a man
That's the trouble with having something to lose
I've been having trouble without you

I've been feeling foolish lately
My sister said don't be a baby
Someday you'll have something real to lose
I can't help the way I feel
'Cause for me, oh this was real

Oh, every kind of trouble
Standin' tall
Honestly, it's trouble with anything at all
Talkin' to my momma
Asking how I am
I don't want to tell her, I'm crying 'bout a man
That's the trouble with having something to lose
I've been havin' trouble without you

That's the trouble with having something to lose
I've been havin' trouble without you

Hide your heart from sight
Lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars, or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh, and down you tumble
Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring

It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how, your arms would be
And it happened to me

Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring

It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how, your arms would be
And it happened
And it happened
And then it happened to me

It always goes like this
Could've predicted it
I'm so naive to think you loved me for me
Kissed as I ran off stage
Too old to play this game
Guess you're still growing up at thirty

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Were you surprised by me?
When you took me home
When the glamor wore off
Reduced to skin and bone
I can't even tell
Who you want to know
I'm a goddess on stage
Human when we're alone

You took a star to bed
Woke up with me instead
You must have felt so damn deceived
When you
Made up a version of
Me that you thought you'd love
But I am not your Aphrodite

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Were you surprised by me?
When you took me home
When the glamour wore off
Reduced to skin and bone
I can't even tell
Who you want to know
I'm a goddess on stage
Human when we're alone

You took me for a fool
You stole my youth
You wanted this so much
You watched me rise
Then killed my light
And now you know
I'm not your fucking goddess

Ooh-oh
Oh-oh
I'm no goddess when I'm alone

I'm doing my Christmas dreaming
A little early this year
No sign of snow around
And yet I go around
Hearing jingle bells ringing in my ear
Your promise must be the reason
The happy season is here
So I'm doing my Christmas dreaming
A little early this year

Hearing jingle bells ringing in my ear
Your promise must be the reason
The happy season is here
So I'm doing my christmas dreaming
A little early this year
The happy season is here

Frosted windowpanes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
"Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true"

And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true

And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too
Merry Christmas

I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold
I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm

I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold
I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm

Winter's upon us so won't you stay
With me from Christmas to New Years Day
Don't leave me alone
I won't
Let's light a fire and let it snow

I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold
I can hold my baby closer to me (to me)
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Mmm mmm...

Sit by my fire
I'll never leave you
Look out the window
Palm trees aglow
Now as I sweat through
My ugly sweater
Christmas with you is
Better than snow

Drive to the ocean
All through December
It would be nice to
Hide from the cold
Then the sun warms me
And I remember
Christmas with you is
Better than snow
Christmas with you is
Better than snow

Watching the waves crash
Down on the shore
I never needed
Anything more
Than you here beside me
Jackfrost won't mind if we
Stay in the heat
Of each other

We'll build sand castles
Instead of snowmen
We'll bake some cookies
Either way
I'll take the warmest
Day of the year 'cause
Christmas with you is
Better than snow
Christmas with you is
Better than snow

Swore I'd seen you before
Watched you walk through the door
Somethin' in your eye
Reminded me of somebody I used to know

You touch my back
I took your hand
Somethin' from your touch felt shockingly familiar
And I'd swore I'd seen you before

Oh, I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night to remember

Then I walked away
You asked me to stay
Now you're thinkin' of what could've been
But you've become someone I've seen before

I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night, enchanting night
To remember

I bought you a present, but you'll never get it
'Cause me and you said our goodbyes this December, oh no
So I went to the furnace
Thought maybe I'd burn it
But hot as a char
I can't even return it, oh no

The most wonderful time of the year is breaking my heart

So tell me this Christmas
Who'll keep you warm?
Who'll put your presents down on the floor?
Under the tree that you bought with me
And watch all those movies that we both have seen
Hundreds of times, I know every line
But it's not about that
It's about the time together on Christmas
So this Christmas ain't Christmas at all

I made cookies for Nicky like you used to do
But, I got so damn sad that I ate one or two
Or them all
So please turn off Mariah I'm not in the mood
'Cause all I want for Christmas wants nothing to do with me now

Oh, the most wonderful time of the year is breaking my heart

So tell me this Christmas
Who'll keep you warm?
Who'll put your presents down on the floor?
Under the tree that you bought with me
And watch all those movies that we both have seen
Hundreds of times, I know every line
But it's not about that
It's about the time together on Christmas
So this Christmas ain't Christmas at all

Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Together on Christmas
So this Christmas ain't Christmas at all

How do you know if you like someone?
Does it happen in steps or all at once?
Is it really like the movies, love at first sight?
Does it hit like lighting, make you starry-eyed?

Because lately I'm feeling nothing
Nothing for myself or anybody else
I'm in no rush but sometimes I think of
How it feels, what it's like to fall in love

How will I know when I've found the one?
Will I see in his smile, whether he is worthwhile?
Tell me, is there a moment, when it all feels right?
Will he make me spin, like a satellite?

Because lately I'm feeling nothing
Nothing for myself or anybody else
I'm in no rush but sometimes I think of
How it feels, what it's like to fall in love

Tell me why is it still
So cold in March?
All I hear is bad news
I sit at home in the blue
Wondering what could have been ours

I didn't want to leave
My timing's always off
I met you at the end of the world
Then got whisked away, now I'm stuck
But I can't say I'm surprised, it's just my luck

Why is everything
Sadder in the dark
It's at night when I cry
And think of every guy
Every guy that I've liked and then lost

I never want to leave
My timing's always off
And even at the end of the world
When I finally find love
I'll get whisked away
But it's okay
It's just my luck

Feeling kind of sick tonight
All I've had is coffee and leftover pie
It's no wonder why

Still you take up all my mind
I don't even think that you care like I do
I should stop
Heaven knows I've tried

One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Some day
Someone will like me like I like you

Until then I'll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again

I'm just tryna understand
What I am to you
More than songs we've exchanged
Midnight calls
Sunset views

Promise I don't mean to cry
But I get overwhelmed and confused
If only you knew
What I felt like

One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Some day
Someone will like me like I like you

Until then I'll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again

Some day
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Until I do
I'll be thinking of you
Let you break my heart again

Love flew away
With no room to land
And it made no mistake
With no legs to stand on
It grew its wings right in place
We said goodbye one last time
As love flew away

Looked in my eyes
We only blinked when we started to cry
Both barely dry
When we finally realized
That we should break the stare
And try not to care
As love flew away

Maybe I'll find you in some other life
We won't be heartbroken half of the time
The ocean between us won't be so grand
Tired after one more one night stand
But we really couldn't stay
So we watched love fly away

Holding your hand
Still feels electric
I'd kiss you but I can't
We're all out of breath
So we whisper among us
For the last time today
As our love flew away

We said goodbye
As love flew away

Hold me close
Hold me tight
Tell me we'll be good tonight

Let's pretend to be fine
I just want one more night

I can tell that you're tired
Speaking less so quiet
I know I'll lose you in the morning
I see it in your eyes
I don't dare to fall asleep
'Cause when I wake you won't be mine

I can tell that you're tired
Speaking less so quiet
I know I'll lose you in the morning
I see it in your eyes
I don't dare to fall asleep
'Cause when I wake you won't be mine

It seems we stood untold like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you were smiling, you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Somethings that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we've met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when?

Somethings that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we've met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when?

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
To sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
